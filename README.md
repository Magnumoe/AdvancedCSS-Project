# TECHNICAL

    Our solution for the project is based on Jquery & Scss.
    We use Jquery primarily for the flow and functionality of the website.
    By flow and functionality we mean how to website behaves from start to finish.
    How the the website behaves when going from section to section and the changing
    background color of the body is the result of this.

    We have also decided that when the website is loaded, it will always start from the top.
    We tried to make the animation trigger both ways, by going both up and down the page, but
    we decided to abandon it, due to technical difficulties.

    The font used is Baskerville. we got the font from Google fonts:
